Task: Student Record Management System

Develop a Java program for managing student records. Create classes and methods to handle
the following tasks:

Create a Student Record Class:

Implement a record named StudentRecord with fields for: String studentId String name
String major double gpa Include appropriate constructors and accessors. Modify
Student Classes:

Introduce two student classes, UndergraduateStudent and GraduateStudent, both extending
a base class Student. Each student class should have a corresponding StudentRecord,
capturing details such as the studentâ€™s ID, name, major, and GPA. Modify Student Record
Management System:

Implement a class named StudentRecordSystem to manage student records. Methods to be
implemented: void addStudentRecord(StudentRecord studentRecord) to add a new student record.
 Optional<StudentRecord> getStudentRecord(String studentId) to retrieve a student
 record based on the student ID. void updateGPA(String studentId, double newGPA)
 to update the GPA for a student.

 Calculate Average GPA:

Implement a method in StudentRecordSystem to calculate the average GPA for all students.
 Main Method and Testing:

In the main method, instantiate the StudentRecordSystem. Add student records for both
undergraduate and graduate students. Test the methods: Add student records. Retrieve student
records. Update GPAs. Calculate the average GPA. Ensure proper encapsulation,
accurate average GPA calculations, and effective testing of the implemented methods.

        studentRecordSystem.addStudentRecord(new StudentRecord("S002", "Jane Smith", "Engineering", 3.9));

        Optional<StudentRecord> studentRecord = studentRecordSystem.getStudentRecord("S001");
        System.out.println("Student Record for S001: " + studentRecord);

        studentRecordSystem.updateGPA("S002", 4.0);

        double averageGPA = studentRecordSystem.avgGpa();
        System.out.println("Average GPA: " + averageGPA);
